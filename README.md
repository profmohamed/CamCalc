For Professional Photographers and Scientific Research
For Professional Photographers and Videographers:
Depth of Field: While the script doesn't directly calculate the depth of field, knowing the aperture and focal length can help photographers estimate it, which is crucial for creating bokeh effects or keeping multiple objects in focus.

Frame Composition: The angle of view can help photographers understand how much of the scene will be captured in the frame, aiding in better composition.

Detail Capture: Knowing the smallest detail size can help in macro photography where capturing minute details is essential.

For Surveillance Systems:
Coverage: The angle of view can be used to calculate the coverage area of surveillance cameras.

Detail Recognition: The smallest detail size can help in determining if the camera is good enough to capture details like license plates or faces from a certain distance.

For Scientific Research:
Measurement Accuracy: In fields like astronomy or microscopic research, knowing the smallest detail size that a camera can capture is crucial for accurate measurements.

Data Collection: Knowing the angle of view and smallest detail can help researchers calibrate their imaging systems for data collection.

For Software Development:
Image Processing: For developers working on image recognition or processing, understanding the camera parameters can help in designing algorithms that are tuned to the specific camera setup.

Simulation and Modeling: In 3D modeling and simulation, accurate camera parameters can help in rendering scenes that are geometrically accurate.

For Drone Imaging:
Path Planning: Knowing the camera parameters can help in planning the drone's flight path to capture the required area and details.

Geo-Mapping: In geographical mapping, knowing the smallest detail size is important for map accuracy.

By inputting the parameters of your camera setup into the script, you can quickly ascertain the capabilities of your system and make informed decisions accordingly
